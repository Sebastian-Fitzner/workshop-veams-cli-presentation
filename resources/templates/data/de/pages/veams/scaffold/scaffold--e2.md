### Scaffold new blueprints

In your new project go into `resources` and create a folder called `blueprints`. In this folder create: 

1. One component (`test-component`) with JavaScript and without WrapWith
2. One block (`test-block`) without JavaScript and without WrapWith
3. One utility (`test-utility`) with JavaScript and with WrapWith

Take a look into the generated files.
