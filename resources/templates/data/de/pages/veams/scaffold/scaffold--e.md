### Scaffold a new project 

Create a new folder called `project-veams`. Go into that folder and scaffold a new project with Veams. Be sure you have installed the following:

- Standard definitions

*Grunt Modules*
- grunt-contrib-handlebars

*Veams*
- Veams Methodology
- Veams-Sass

DON'T install Veams-JS! Start your project with `npm run start`.
