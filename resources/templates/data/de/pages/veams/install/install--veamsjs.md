Veams-JS can be installed with this command: 

``` bash
veams install veams-js
```

In short:

``` bash
veams -i vjs
```
Every JavaScript file in your project with the same filename will be replaced. Also it could be that you manually have to insert the `_get-media.scss` in your `styles.scss`.

_In general for every new project you do not have to do anything manually._
