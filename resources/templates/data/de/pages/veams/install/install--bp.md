You can also install blueprints which are saved on your local machine.

``` bash
veams install blueprint [path-to-blueprint] [type]
```
In short: 

``` bash
veams -i bc [path-to-blueprint] [type]
```

#### Example

Let's take the same example as with our bower-component. 

To install the slider you can type the following: 

``` bash
veams -i bp C:\bp\slider component
```
