To install Grunt plugins you can do the following

``` bash
veams install grunt-module
```
In short: 

``` bash
veams -i gm
```

You can choose from a list [Veams provides](http://www.veams.org/veams-cli/project/grunt-plugins.html). 

When you want to integrate the new Grunt plugin into your build workflow you need to add the task to your `Gruntfile.js`.
