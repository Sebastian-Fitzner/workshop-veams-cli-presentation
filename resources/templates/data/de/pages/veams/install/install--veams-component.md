Any Veams-Component (or Veams-Utility) can be installed with this command: 

``` bash
veams install veams-component [name]
```

In short:

``` bash
veams -i vc [name]
```

All partials, scss files, data files, JavaScript files and snippets are automagically inserted in your project while you are developing. 

#### Example

To install the Veams-Component `table` (veams-component-table) just do the following in your project:

``` bash
veams -i vc table
```
